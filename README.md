# IST719-FPL-analysis-project
Exploratory analysis and visualizations for the 2018-19 Fantasy Premier League season.

# Story
FPL is a fantasy league of the best football league in the world. It’s been a case for quite some time that the world’s most popular football league no longer involves only 20 managers in the world, but rather millions. Every manager agonizes over a squad of 15 players with a small budget of £100 million.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of English Premier League’s fantasy league data which I found on Kaggle. It consists of 552 rows and 21 columns. ‘Points’, ‘Position’, ‘Cost’ and ‘Team’ are the main variables used for subsetting and aggregating. The cost is given in units of £0.1 million. Infuence, Creaticity and Threat (and consequently ICT) are all metrics that FPL came up with to try and assess player performance. TSB refers to the percent of FPL user teams that the player is in.

# Audience
EPL draws the highest global television audience of any football league. Any person with a remote interest in the fantasy league would be interested in the insights generated from this project.
